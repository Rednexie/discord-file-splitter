### Discord File Splitter

Not everyone has a cloud file storage subscription, but we might have some files to store and out disk space might not be enough to store those files. So we need somewhere free to store our files on. Discord is one of the best free solutions, since it is a chat platorm and it doesn't have any limits per account. But there is one problem: The max file size discord accepts is 25 MB.


Discord File Splitter solves this problem by giving you the ability to split your file into parts that you can upload to discord. And when you need them, you can download and combine them so you can get the original file back without any data loss.

Discord File Splitter provides 3 interfaces for this functionality.

- Native Desktop App
The dfs desktop app works on all desktop platforms thanks to electron.
- Command Line Interface
The cli is made for Android devices with Termux and Node.js installations.
- The Web Interface
